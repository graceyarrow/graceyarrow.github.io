        <p><span class="intro">Cal Ripken Jr.</span> doesn't listen to rap, but rappers know Cal Ripken.</p>
        <p>Known as the Iron Man for his record 2,632 consecutive game streak 
        playing for the Baltimore Orioles, Ripken is now retired and living in 
        Annapolis. But with 17 years out of the game and nearly a quarter century
        since his streak ended, his streak of hip-hop references is still going strong.</p>
        <p>The baseball legend has been mentioned in some shape or form in more 
        than 50 rap songs since 1998 and as recently as this fall.</p>

        <p>Ripken said he's more of a country fan, but credits the relatability of 
            his record for making him a rap
            legend.</p>
            <p>“I'm amazed how many people relate to the streak. It wasn't about 
            breaking Lou Gehrig's record. It was about values,” Ripken said. “I've heard 
            people's stories from being in the factory every day to teachers
            in the classroom.”</p>
            <p>For rappers like <span class="name">A$AP Ant</span>, the Baltimore-bred 
            former A$AP Mob member, Ripken brings a dose of nostalgia into his music.</p>
            <p>“I grew up watching baseball. Cal Ripken was ... like a Baltimore hero. 
            Like how Ray Lewis is,” he said.
            “That's the one thing that we got. When people don't know Baltimore for 
            nothing, they know Baltimore for Cal Ripken. Kids looked up to him and wanted to be him.”</p>
            <p>Ant is one of the most recent rappers to feature Cal in his lyrics and 
            the artwork for his single. Below, check out his song and the rest of Cal Ripken's rap history.</p>

                <p>Ripken broke Gehrig's record on Sept. 6, 1995, but it wasn't until 1998 
                when he had already surpassed the record by 502 games, that he decided to end 
                the streak. It was also this year that rap legends began to use the newly 
                certified baseball legend in their lyrics.</p>
                <p>The late <span class="name">Phife Dawg</span> was Ripken's biggest fan 
                of this era, comparing himself to the Iron Man in two different songs. 
                <span class="name">Lil Wayne</span> would go on to reuse his Ripken
                line in the song “BM J.R.” from his 2004 album “Tha Carter.”</p>
